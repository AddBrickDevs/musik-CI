     <description>Hailing from Burlington, Vt, Madelines were one of the core indie bands of the 90\'s.  The music is lush with a standard line up of guitars, bass, drums, with the sweet, sweet voice of Colin Clary.  The highlight recording was Your Motives Kill Me, which was the soundtrack to any hip indie kid\'s life in the late 90\'s.  The guitars are melodic most of the time, without sounding wimpy.  Portions of the band went on to other projects such as the magic is gone, pilot to gunner, and you can catch C</description>

     <description>“I want to be the conductor of your emotions. I want everyone to smile with me, to laugh with me, to cry with me, to love with me, even to die with me. I want to change the world, am I am naïve enough to believe that it is possible. Music could write the doctrine of world peace and if everyone stopped all of their nonsense and just sang a song, held hands, and loved, then maybe we could stop fighting over invisible boundary lines and green colored paper.

     <description>The question of nature vs. nurture often arises as a child grows and his destiny begins to make itself evident. For a lucky few, there is no such question because both clearly played a starring role. Twenty-four year old Madrid native Rayito is just such a person. Born to musically gifted parents, Rayito was steered by his Gypsy father, a Flamenco guitar player himself, to follow in their family’s tradition of virtuosity. By age 4, Rayito gave his first concert.
